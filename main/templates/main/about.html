            It's a meetup.com clone in the spirit of HN. Crazy fast and ridiculously minimal.

        <div class="section-label">Why?</div>
        <div class="section-body">
            Because meetup.com is slow, has a new dislikable design and does not send emails consistently.
        </div>

        <div class="section-label">Pricing</div>
        <div class="section-body">
            For the time being the service is free of charge.
        </div>
